# TravelingSalesmanProblem-Visual
This project solves the traveling salesman problem with 3 different approaches. These are:
1) Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
2) Greedy Algorithm
3) Divide and Conquer Strategy

https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/TSP.ipynb -> described in this notebook.

The project also provides a visual representation of the solution, we used Java-Swing for this.

Example Solution Of Canada Cities (4663 City)
